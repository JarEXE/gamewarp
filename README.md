##Host at specific address:

## Description

Gamewarp is a React web application that offers a simple demo of a video game webshop.

## Note

This was made for my personal portfolio.

The idea is something similar to a service that a restaurant or small business owner would provide.

The business is run locally (physical store, warehouse etc.) and the owner is in need of a simple webshop where customers can place orders.

Once an order is placed, the store would deliver the items to the specified location and receive payments in person.

As this was meant to be nothing more than a simple demo, I will likely not be improving or adding to this in any way.

Though there are MANY ways in which something like this can be greatly improved.

## Possible additions for improving this application

Stripe / Paypal integration for receiving payments prior to delivery.

Admin login which would allow store workers / owner / admins to add, remove, or update items or orders.

Custom database / API for managing admins, users, customers, and items.

E-mail notifications to configured app admins / workers to notify new incoming orders.

etc...
